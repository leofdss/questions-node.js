<h2>Validate Subsequence</h2>
<p>
  Given two non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines
  whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one.
</p>
<p>
  A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent
  in the array but that are in the same order as they appear in the array. For
  instance, the numbers <span>[1, 3, 4]</span> form a subsequence of the array
  <span>[1, 2, 3, 4]</span>, and so do the numbers <span>[2, 4]</span>. Note
  that a single number in an array and the array itself are both valid
  subsequences of the array.

<h3>Sample Input</h3>
<pre>
  <span>array</span> = [5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10]
  <span>sequence</span> = [1, 6, -1, 10]
</pre>

<h3>Sample Output</h3>
<pre>
  true
</pre>
